Time after time
Heart to heart
Boys will be boys
Hand in hand
Get ready get set go
Hour to hour
Sorry, not sorry
Over and over
Home sweet home
Smile smile smile at your mind as often as possible.
Alone, alone at last
Now you see me now you donâ€™t
Rain rain go away
All for one and one for all
It is what it is
